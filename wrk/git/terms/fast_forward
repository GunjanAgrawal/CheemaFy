fast forwarding means when one commit is just a child of other commit.
when we are going from parent commit to child commit it is called fast forwarding.

lemme explain parent and child

suppose A-B-C-D-E(master)-F-G(feature2)
            \
            H-I-J(feature1)

this time if you stand on E(master and say to merge it will be fast forwarding as G is direct child of E)
    git checkout master
    git merge feature2
