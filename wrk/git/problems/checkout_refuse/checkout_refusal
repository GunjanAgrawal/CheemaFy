generally git refuses to checkout when it gets confused

1. i have untracked a file in one branch
    now i wanted to switch to another branch
    now git saw that that file is already in this branch
    it will refuse to checkout there as it wanted to create a file there but it is still there

2. generally git checkout carries unstaged/staged/untracked changes along with itself
    but while moving if it find another version of that file there then it will face difficulty
